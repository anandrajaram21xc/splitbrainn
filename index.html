<b>About:</b><br />
This tool connects with your Google Contacts account. It loads the phone numbers
of all contacts and reformats them. Country prefixes are added, dashes and dots
removed and area codes from some countries are separated from the rest of the
number.
</p>

<p>
<b>Warranty:</b><br />
A preview of how the fixed numbers will look like is shown before any action is
taken. Creating a backup of your contacts is recommended before running this
application. <b>Absolutely no Warranties are given.</b> Use at your own risk.
</p>

<p>
<b>Security:</b><br />
No data is transferred to any 3rd party - the whole application is running
with your browser and Google's API servers. You are welcome to
<a href="https://github.com/splitbrain/googlephonefix">download the sources</a>
and run it on your own computer.
